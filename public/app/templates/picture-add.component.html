<!--
    The first thing that happens in our UI is the user picks a file and the 
    fileChangeEvent is triggered.  The event includes a lot of information that 
    is useless to us.  We only want the File array which we store in a 
    filesToUpload scope.
    When a file is chosen from the picker, the fileChangeEvent function is called 
    and an object is passed.  Weâ€™re looking for object.target.files
-->

<form enctype="multipart/form-data" accept="image/*" [hidden]="fileUploaded">
    <input type="file" (change)="fileChangeEvent($event)" placeholder="Upload file..." name="uploads[]" />
    <button type="button" (click)="upload()">Upload</button>
</form>

<div [hidden]="!fileUploaded">
    <p class="bg-success">File uploaded successfully!</p>
    <a [routerLink]="['Profiles']" class="btn btn-primary">Go back</a>
</div>
